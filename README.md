CEN4090L first assignment (Repo and pull request)
My name is Jeyma Rodriguez. I was born and raised in Cuba. I'm a CS senior student at FSU, expecting to graduate this Fall 2023. I'm very exited to start working as a Software engineer and grow as a programmer. I'm the social Chair of WICS(Women in Computer Science) since October 2021. I'm very creative and I love to reflect that on my projects when I have the opportunity. I hope my last semester will help me to feel more prepared to start my path as a software engineer.
